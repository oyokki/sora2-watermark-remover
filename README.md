# Description
This project is designed to precisely remove watermarks from Sora 2 generated videos using AI.

# How it works?
This project uses AI to remove watermarks from Sora 2 generated videos. When a user uploads a video, the system analyzes each frame to detect the watermark and removes it using inpainting. The processed video is then rendered and returned to the user.

# Requirementsüõ†
- Python 3.10+
- Windows/MacOS/Linux
- At least 4GB of RAM
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
